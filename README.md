[***pulamusic***](pulamusic.com) is a brand name I created a number of years ago to represent the breadth of what I do as an academic and musician. The word *pula* means *rain* in Setswana, the national language of Botswana where I lived and worked as a teacher and trainer from 1991-99. Since Botswana is a desert country -- the Kalahari Desert -- rain is an important environmental element, bringing life and luck and prosperity. It is an image that rings true to me still in terms of how I approach my work and the people around me.
